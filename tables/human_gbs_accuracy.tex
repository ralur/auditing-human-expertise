\caption{
Comparing the accuracy of physician hospitalization decisions (`Physician Discretion') to those made by thresholding the GBS.
For example, `Admit GBS $> 1$' hospitalizes patients with a GBS strictly larger than $1$.  
`Fraction Hospitalized' indicates the fraction of patients hospitalized by each rule.
`Accuracy' indicates the 0/1 accuracy of each rule, where a decision is correct if it hospitalizes a patient who suffers an adverse outcome (as defined above) or discharges a patient who does not.
`Sensitivity' indicates the fraction of patients who suffer an adverse outcome that are correctly hospitalized,
and `Specificity' indicates the fraction of patients who do not suffer an adverse outcome that are correctly discharged.
Results are reported to $\pm 2$ standard errors.
