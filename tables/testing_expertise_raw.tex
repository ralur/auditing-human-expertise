\caption{The results of running ExpertTest, where each pair of patients is chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to nine patient characteristics. The Glasgow-Blatchford score is computed from these nine characteristics, after a pre-processing step which discretizes each feature.. $L$ indicates the number of pairs selected for the test, of which `mismatched pairs' are not identical to each other.
                   Swaps that decrease (respectively, increase) loss indicates how many of the $L$ pairs result in a decrease (respectively, increase) in the 0/1 loss
                   when their corresponding hospitalization decisions are exchanged with each other. $\tau$ is the p-value obtained
                   from running ExpertTest.}
